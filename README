Placevent
This program is designed to automatically place explicit solvent atoms/ions based
on 3D-RISM data. The 3D-RISM correlations should be in a DX file

The details of the algorithm are described in: 
Placevent: An algorithm for prediction of explicit solvent atom distribution -- Awpplication to HIV-1 protease and F-ATP synthase

If you have Numpy, this package should work out of the box. Please contact me if you have problems.
This package requires Numpy.

There is a degree of uncertainty in the placement due to the conversion of continuous distribution to
a discrete one. The atoms are printed in PDB format with the beta term reflecting the uncertainty.
